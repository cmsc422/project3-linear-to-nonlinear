# CMSC422 - Project 3 - Perceptrons, SVMs, Neural networks
---

In this project, you will work with perceptrons, support vector machines, and neural networks. By completing this assignment, you will develop an intuition for how each algorithm works, understand some key aspects of decision boundary geometry, the connection between theory and model development, hyperparameter optimization, kernels, methods for regularization, interpreting models, and more. Finally you will apply these algorithms to canonical prediction tasks, by training, evaluating, and interpreting your own models.

As usual, we expect you to complete the notebooks in this homework
and fill in the missing implementations.

Please do not edit function names or parameters as your code will be tested
using a test harness.

I recommend that you complete notebooks in the following order:

1. Perceptrons
2. SVMs
3. Neural networks
