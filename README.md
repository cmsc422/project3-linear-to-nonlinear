# CMSC422 - Project 3 - Perceptrons, SVMs, Neural networks
---

In this project, we will understand perceptrons, support vector machines, and neural networks. You will then apply them to different learning tasks.

As usual, we expect you to complete the notebooks in this homework
and fill in the missing implementations.

Please do not edit function names or parameters as your code will be tested
using a test harness.
